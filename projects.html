        <h2>User Modeling for XAI</h2>
        <p style="margin: 2% 25%;">
            For this project, Owen researched the facotrs that go into an explanation such as the levels and methods of
            explanation, as well as the factors that influence a persons ability to be explained to. He then created a
            model that incorporates these factors
            to create an algorithm that cators explanations to users. He will be testing this model in a user study
            later this year.
        </p>
        <h2>Deep Learning for Bio Technology</h2>
        <p style="margin: 2% 25%;">
            In this project Owen used explainability tools to identify how the current best algorithms work when
            identifying off
            target mutations. He then created a Siamese neural network in an attempt to outperform these model.
        </p>
        <h2>Astroid Game</h2>
        <p style="margin: 2% 25%;">
            Outside of school Owen enjoys pursuing his own projects. One of these is a game called astroid dodger where
            the user must pilor a ship through astroids that move accross the screen. Owen is currently in the middle of
            improving a genetic algorithms
            ability to play this game.
        </p>
        <h2>Website Creation</h2>
        <p style="margin: 2% 25%;">
            During his undergrad Owen was part of a club called Enactus who's goal was to improve the community. On this
            club Owen was the project leader for a group who's goal was to build websites for small businesses and then
            teach them how to maintain it.
            Owen built 5 websites for business in his hometown and supported the business owners while they learned the
            technology.
