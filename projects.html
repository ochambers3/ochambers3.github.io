        <h2>User Modeling for XAI</h2>
        <p style="margin: 2% 25%;">
            For this project, Owen researched the facotrs that go into an explanation such as the levels and methods of
            explanation, as well as the factors that influence a persons ability to be explained to. He then created a
            model that incorporates these factors
            to create an algorithm that cators explanations to users. He will be testing this model in a user study
            later this year.

        <h2>Deep Learning for Bio Technology</h2>
        <p style="margin: 2% 25%;">
            In this project Owen used explainability tools to identify how the current best algorithms work when
            identifying off
            target mutations. He then created a Siamese neural network in an attempt to outperform these model.

        <h2>Astroid Game</h2>
        <p style="margin: 2% 25%;">
            Outside of school Owen enjoys pursuing his own projects. One of these is a game called astroid dodger where
            the user must pilor a ship through astroids that move accross the screen. Owen is currently in the middle of
            improving a genetic algorithms
            ability to play this game.

        <h2>Website Creation</h2>
        <p style="margin: 2% 25%;">
            During his undergrad Owen was part of a club called Enactus who's goal was to improve the community. On this
            club Owen was the project leader for a group who's goal was to build websites for small businesses and then
            teach them how to maintain it.
            Owen built 5 websites for business in his hometown and supported the business owners while they learned the
            technology.

  <h3>User-Specific Explanations of AI: A User Study</h3>
  <p class="project-description" id="UserSpecific-description">It is more pertinant now than ever that people are able to understand the output that AI generates. This is true for developers but especially for people with no technical background. For my thesis at the University of Waterloo I performed an extensive literature review to understand the facters that lead to a person accepting or rejecting an explanation from an AI, and then built an AI model that would predict the amount of and method of explanation that is most preferred. I tested AI against other preeddiction methods in a user study and determined that my developed method was statistically more proficient. I then developed several AI models to use the collected dataset from the user study, to gain further insights about this topic. This thesis allowed me to gain knowledge designing and running a user study, information surrounding user-specific explanations of AI, and current methods being used in the world of AI.</p>

  <h3>Deep-learning for Biotechnology</h3>
  <p class="project-description" id="bioTech-description">The CRISPR Cas9 protein is currently being used to edit the human genome. This protein is capable of receiving a DNA sequence, and then locating this sequence in the genome to replace the DNA sequence with another, or to be removed all together. One of the most challenging problems involving this task is predicting when the Cas9 protein will make an incorrect edit. Current best practices involve using a CNN to look at the DNA-RNA strands in small localized groups to make a prediction. In this project I used a siamese neural network which would produce an output based on the DNA, and RNA sequences seperately, and then make a prediciton based on the difference of output. This was found to be a valid method as it produced results slightly worse than the current best practice using the CNN. One of the issues with this project was that the Cas9 protein does not make mistakes very often, and as a result a result a DNN can get a very high accuracy by predicting one group (no error) every time. Investigating the trade-off between accuracy on the dataset and accuracy on a specific group still requires more investigation. The next step with this project that I would like to persue is using a transformer like BERT to view the DNA-RNA sequences as a string of letters, instead of an array of numbers to see if interpreting the data as a word can provide additional insight.</p>

  <h3>Fantasy Hockey Genetic Algorithm</h3>
  <p class="project-description" id="fantasyGA-description">In my fantasy hockey league, players get 6 points for a goal, 4 for an assist, 2 for any point on the power-play, and then more points for shots, blocked shots, hits, and game winning goals. This point distribution was chosen by the app we use to play, but I wasnted to know if this point distribution was exactly correct or if there was something I could exploit to help me win my league. Using the dataset of statistics from last season, I created a fantasy hockey genetic algorithm which learned playing against itself drafting players and comparing expected points. This GA started out randomly assigning a number of points to goals, assists, etc, and learned how best to weight the attributes in order to draft a winning hockey team. This taught me that goals are overvalued and assists are undervalued by my league. I assume that this is because it is much easier to get an assist than a goal, and they are only worth two less points. One of the issues I immediately ran into is that my friends who I am playing against are picking players based on point performance whether its by assists or not. Because of this there were not as many undervalued players left available as I would have liked. However, since implementing this algorithm I have focused on selecting players who play on high scoring lines, but may not get a lot of goals. Since implementing this algorithm, at the time of this update, I am undefeated in my league.<p>

  <h3>AI Generated Music</h3>
  <p class="project-description" id="classicalMusic-description">AI generated music continues to be a challenge that researchers have been trying to tackle for quite some time. For my thesis at Brandon University I created an AI model which could take a classical music composition, and rearrange the work using similar expresive motifes and patterns to create a unique piece of music. This project taught me many things including the importance of planning ahead, and doing as much reserach as possible at the start of a project. Although I was very happy with the music that my AI was able to produce, it came a long way from being able to mach the masterpieces created by Bach and Mozart centuries ago. The next place I would like to take this project is taking concepts from other genres of music and incorporating them into classical pieces.</p>

  <h3>Website Creation</h3>
  <p class="project-description" id="website-description">At Brandon University, I had the pleasure of leading a team of students to better our community through building websites and creatingn online presences for small businesses. As project manager, I was able to gain useful experience interacting with business leaders, delegating tasks, and leading by example to ensure we were meeting all of our goals. This project involved meeting and working with businesses to develop target goals, and then working with my team to make these goals a reality. After we were satisfied with our work, I would hold meetings with the businesses to instruct them how to update and maintain their websites so that they would be self-sufficient after we left. This project was very rewarding as we were able to see the direct impact we were making in our community.</p>
